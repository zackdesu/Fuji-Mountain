        <h1>Mount Fuji</h1>
        <p>
            Mount Fuji, an iconic symbol of Japan, holds deep historical and cultural significance. This majestic
            mountain formed approximately 2.6 million years ago through volcanic activity. It became a focal point for
            pilgrimages during the 12th century, with numerous shrines and temples established along its climbing
            routes. Over the centuries, Mount Fuji captured the imagination of artists, writers, and poets, becoming a
            celebrated subject in Japanese art and literature, particularly during the Edo period.
        </p>

            During the Edo period (1603-1868), Mount Fuji rose to prominence as it became a popular subject in ukiyo-e
            prints, showcasing its striking beauty and captivating presence. Artists sought to capture the essence of
            the mountain, depicting it in various seasons and atmospheric conditions. Writers and poets were also
            inspired by its grandeur, composing haikus and poems that praised its majesty. Mount Fuji became an integral
            part of Japanese cultural identity, representing beauty, spirituality, and national pride.
        </p>

            As international interest in mountaineering grew in the 19th century, Mount Fuji attracted adventurers from
            around the world. The first recorded foreign ascent took place in 1860, sparking a trend of international
            climbers attempting to conquer its summit. This influx of climbers contributed to Mount Fuji's global
            recognition and established it as a renowned destination for mountaineering enthusiasts.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Recognizing the natural and cultural significance of Mount Fuji, the Japanese government declared it a
            national park in 1936. This designation aimed to protect the mountain's unique ecosystem and preserve its
            historical and religious importance. In 2013, Mount Fuji was further acknowledged for its exceptional value
            and universal significance when it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This prestigious recognition
            solidified Mount Fuji's status as a global treasure and an enduring symbol of Japan's natural and cultural
            heritage.
        </p>

            Today, Mount Fuji continues to attract millions of visitors each year. Its climbing season, typically from
            early July to mid-September, witnesses a surge of climbers seeking to conquer its summit. Mount Fuji offers
            several climbing routes and mountain huts to accommodate the adventurers along the way. The mountain's rich
            history, spiritual significance, and breathtaking beauty make it a cherished destination for those who yearn
